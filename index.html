        <h1>MAHATMA GANDHI</h1><br>
        <h4>INDIAN FREEDOM FIGHTER</h4>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, was a preeminent leader and political figure who played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence from British rule. He is revered as the Father of the Indian nation and is known for his principles of nonviolence, civil disobedience, and peaceful resistance.

            Gandhi's life was guided by his unwavering commitment to truth, justice, and equality. He advocated for the rights of the marginalized, fought against discrimination, and sought to unite people of all backgrounds and religions. His philosophy of Satyagraha, or "truth-force," emphasized the power of nonviolent resistance in achieving social and political change.
            
            Gandhi's most significant contribution to the Indian independence movement was his leadership in the Salt March of 1930. In protest against the British salt monopoly, he led a 240-mile march to the Arabian Sea, where he symbolically made salt from seawater. This act of civil disobedience galvanized the nation and drew international attention to India's struggle for freedom.</p>
